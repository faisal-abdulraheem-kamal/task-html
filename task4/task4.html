                <h3>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h3>
                <p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's<br> standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it
                    to make a type<br> specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. <br>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
                    Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop <br>publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

                <h3>Where does it come from ?</h3>
                <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,<br> making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in
                    Virginia,
                    <br> looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word<br> in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32
                    <br> 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise<br> on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum,<br>                    "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32..</p>
